Babson Analytics Hackathon | Merchandising Analytics Case Study

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
Our customers use visual media to inform, educate, and inspire purchasing decisions.  You recently launched an A/B test that showed when Rich Media (i.e. video, 3D imagery, and interactive content) is present on our Product Details Page (PDP), we see upwards of 7% conversion rate lift depending on the Product Class and content type (see Exhibit A & B for details).  The Wayfair Merchandising team is looking to capitalize on this opportunity by increasing Rich Media content across the catalog.  Not every product has this content as we rely on Suppliers to use our proprietary visual merchandising platform, called WayMore, to design a PDP layout that differentiates their products (see exhibit C below for an example).   

We have provided you with multiple datasets at the product class, Supplier, and SKU level that will help inform what Rich Media gaps exist (see Appendix for details on full dataset).

<h2>The Merchandising Analytics team (you) has been tasked with building a recommendation on one or more of the following topics:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Supplier outreach strategy -- including Suppliers to target, prioritized SKU lists, etc. </li>
  <li>Opportunity size for filling Rich Media gaps</li>
  <li>Improve the customer experience through product content optimization</li>
  <li>Any other recommendations for Merchandising Leadership</li>
</ul>
